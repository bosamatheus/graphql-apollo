# GraphQL API with Apollo Server

## Introduction

- Problem: overfetching using REST APIs.
- Serverless architecture: pay per use according to data throughput.

## GraphQL notes

- Every request is POST.
- Just one endpoint _/graphql_.
- Query: gets info (GET).
- Mutation: manipulates data (POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE).
- Scalar Types: String, Int, Boolean, Float, and ID.
